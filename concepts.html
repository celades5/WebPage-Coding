            <h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
        </header>
        <p>-The header can be a starting point for the whole document or individual sections. It typically contains the introduction.

                - simply an area to add any introductory content about your page. It can contains headings, paragraphs, tables, images, logos and even navigation.
                - It goes from h1 to h6 being h1 the most important header.
                - extremely helpful as a navigation tool for assistive technology users
        </p>
        <p>-The nav refers to navigation. It could contain a set of navigation links, such as a table of contents of a book.</p>
        <p>-The section refers to sections in a document. For example, a document about plants could contain several sections under headings such as perennials, annuals, soil type, etc.</p>
        <p>-The aside refers to content that is apart from the main content. For example, in an article about a young architect from the Umbria region of Italy. The aside might be a small sidebar with information about Umbria, things like geographical details and population.</p>
        <p>-The article refers to independent content. If an article is extracted out of the document, it should make sense all by itself. Articles, blog posts, frequently asked questions (FAQ) are all examples of independent content.</p>
        <p>-The footer contains typical footer information such as authoring, copyrights and contact information.</p>
